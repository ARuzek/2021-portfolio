            <h2>FAQ</h2>
       <details>
            <summary>Do you do UI/UX or Development?</summary>
            <p>I've worked in roles that include visual design, experience and product architecture, research, strategy, development, design-ops, dev-ops, and leadership. My skillset might be labeled as a design-ops specialist, full-stack designer, front of front-end developer, or UX Developer. </p>
            <p>Fun fact: I've also taken continuing education courses in 3D modeling, animation, and software development for gaming, computer generated art, and internet-of-things (IoT) devices</p>
            <p> ðŸšœ I currently work as a UI/UX team lead at Caterpillar. </p>

            <summary>What are your leadership values and guiding principles?</summary>
            <p><strong>Diversity and inclusion</strong> mean a lot to me. I love to view problems from multiple angles and solutions. When other people come from different backgrounds and experiences with different ideas than my own, I actively seek to include them at the table. I think teams of different expertise and opinion foster a healthier environment for innovation to flourish. </p>
            <p><strong>Continuous learning</strong> is something else that I value. Knowing a little bit about different fields of work helps to inform my decisions, makes me more empathetic, and a better leader. I encourage all my peers to keep a growth mindset. Every change is an opportunity to grow.</p>

            <summary>Why doesn't this portfolio have a lot of pictures?</summary>
            <p>This journal portfolio is not visual for two reasons. Firstly, I haven't contributed to visual design of projects for a few years now. Secondly, many of the projects that I work on are not yet available to the public. </p>

            <h2>Design System for Caterpillar Earthmoving Machinery Displays</h2>
            <main>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Role</dt>
                    <dd>Technical Architect</dd>
                    <dt>Situation</dt>
                    <dd>The Caterpillar Earthmoving division in-cab display was built using restrictive technologies that didn't allow for responsive design, animations, or on-the-fly styling updates. This led to diminished perception of brand by the end customers and inconsistencies internally between UI/UX division teams able or unable to provide interactive experiences on the displays.</dd>
                    <dt>Goal</dt>
                    <dd>When the software teams responsible for the in-cab display began to investigate alternative web-based technologies, I was tasked with designing, developing, demonstrating, and evaluating a new UI/UX design system process that would facilitate internal consistency and meet the demands of the customer.</dd>
                    <dt>Tools</dt>
                    <dd> Azure DevOps, Azure Cloud Web Application Service, CI/CD (Azure Pipeline w/ YAML, bash, Node, various APIs), CSS, Git, HTML, JavaScript, Lit, Markdown, ModernWeb, NPM, Storybook, TypeScript, UXPin, VSCode, VuePress  
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Impact</dt>
                    <dd>As a result of the new process, teams are able to maintain a consistent source of design truth. Web components enable cross-framework code sharing. Continuous testing maintains quality. Documentation ensures clear communication. Direct access to code based components in design based tools such as UXPin allow designers to create prototypes for user research faster than ever before.</dd>
